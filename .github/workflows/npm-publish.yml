# This workflow will run tests using node and then publish a package to GitHub Packages when a release is created
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-nodejs-packages

# when someone changes the version in package.json to 1.2.3 and pushes a commit with the message Release 1.2.3, the npm-publish action will create a new tag v1.2.3 and publish the package to the npm registry.
#
# Inputs
# These inputs are optional: that means that if you don't enter them, default values will be used and it'll work just fine.
#
# tag_name: the name pattern of the new tag (the placeholder '%s' must be there)
# tag_message: the message pattern of the new tag (the placeholder '%s' must be there)
# commit_pattern: pattern that the commit message needs to follow
